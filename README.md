# Digital Fatigue & Burnout Risk Prediction System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project detects digital fatigue based on user behavioral data and predicts future burnout risk using machine learning.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Excessive digital usage leads to mental fatigue and burnout, especially among students and professionals. There is no simple system to detect this early.

## 💡 Solution
The system collects digital behavior data, calculates a fatigue score, and predicts burnout risk using a trained ML model.

## 🧠 Features
- Digital fatigue score (Low / Medium / High)
- Burnout risk prediction (Low / High)
- Machine learning based prediction
- Web interface using Flask
- SQLite database for data storage

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- SQLite
- Scikit-learn
- Flask
- HTML
